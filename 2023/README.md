# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This solutions are scaffolded and run using the advent of code rust template by Felix SpÃ¶ttel ([repo](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust)).

## Usage

### Scaffold a day

```sh
# example: `cargo scaffold 1`
cargo scaffold <day>

# output:
# Created module "src/bin/01.rs"
# Created empty input file "src/inputs/01.txt"
# Created empty example file "src/examples/01.txt"
# ---
# ðŸŽ„ Type `cargo solve 01` to run your solution.
```

Individual solutions live in the `./src/bin/` directory as separate binaries.

Every [solution](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust/blob/main/src/bin/scaffold.rs#L11-L41) has _unit tests_ referencing its _example_ file. Use these unit tests to develop and debug your solution against the example input. For some puzzles, it might be easier to forgo the example file and hardcode inputs into the tests.

When editing a solution, `rust-analyzer` will display buttons for running / debugging unit tests above the unit test blocks.

### Download input for a day

> **Note**  
> This command requires [installing the aoc-cli crate](#download-puzzle-inputs-via-aoc-cli).

```sh
cargo download <day> [-y/--year <year>]
```

### Download puzzle inputs for a day

1. Install [`aoc-cli`](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/) via cargo: `cargo install aoc-cli --version 0.5.0`.
2. Create an `.adventofcode.session` file in your home directory and paste your session cookie[^1] into it. To get this, press F12 anywhere on the Advent of Code website to open your browser developer tools. Look in your Cookies under the Application or Storage tab, and copy out the `session` cookie value.

Once installed, you can use the [download command](#download-input-for-a-day).

```sh
# example: `cargo download 1`
cargo download <day>
```

### Run solutions for a day

```sh
# example: `cargo solve 01`
cargo solve <day>
```

### Run all solutions

```sh
cargo all
```

### Run all solutions against the example input

```sh
cargo test
```

To run tests for a specific day, append `--bin <day>`, e.g. `cargo test --bin 01`. You can further scope it down to a specific part, e.g. `cargo test --bin 01 part_one`.
